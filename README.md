## Helpful notes
* For this project, I used Hotwire and Stimulus for the front-end part.
* There is a "model" Pokemon to simulate a database instance, but this project didn't have a database.
* I added Bulma CSS styles just to add a little bit more design, but this project did not focus on the CSS part.
* I used both Gem and API to connect with the Pok√©mon repository. Same as the previous point, it's just to exemplify both connections. I recommend using the gem.
